I'm sorry that I did this
<br>
The blood is on my hands
<br>
I stare at my reflection
<br>
I don't know who I am
<br>

<br>
Practice my confession
<br>
In case I take the stand
<br>
I'll say I learned my lesson
<br>
I'll be a better man
<br>

<br>
I'm packing up my things
<br>
And I'm wiping down the walls
<br>
I'm rinsing off my clothes
<br>
And I'm walking through the halls
<br>

<br>
I did it all for her
<br>
So I felt nothing at all
<br>
I don't know what she'll say
<br>
So I'll ask her when she calls
<br>

<br>
Would you love me more
<br>
If I killed someone for you?
<br>
Would you hold my hand?
<br>
They're the same ones that I used
<br>
When I killed someone for you
<br>

<br>
Would you turn me in
<br>
When they say I'm on the loose?
<br>
Would you hide me when
<br>
My face is on the news?
<br>
'Cause I killed someone for you
<br>

<br>
I hear the sirens coming
<br>
I see the flashing lights
<br>
I'm driving through the suburbs
<br>
Wearing my disguise
<br>

<br>
I show up at her doorstep
<br>
To look her in the eyes
<br>
I tell her that it's me
<br>
But she doesn't recognise
<br>

<br>
Can't you see I'm running?
<br>
Said I need a place to hide
<br>
I've gotta ask you something
<br>
Could you please let me inside?
<br>

<br>
Just let me explain
<br>
No, I wouldn't tell you lies
<br>
I know you'll understand
<br>
If you let me stay the night
<br>

<br>
Would you love me more
<br>
If I killed someone for you?
<br>
Would you hold my hand?
<br>
They're the same ones that I used
<br>
When I killed someone for you
<br>

<br>
Would you turn me in
<br>
When they say I'm on the loose?
<br>
Would you hide me when
<br>
My face is on the news?
<br>
'Cause I killed someone for you
<br>

<br>
You have to understand that
<br>
The one I killed is me
<br>
Changing what I was
<br>
For what you wanted me to be
<br>

<br>
I followed your direction
<br>
Did everything you asked
<br>
I hope that makes you happy
<br>
'Cause there's just no turning back
<br>
Would you love me more
<br>
If I killed someone for you?
<br>
Would you hold my hand?
<br>
They're the same ones that I used
<br>
When I killed someone for you
<br>

<br>
Would you turn me in
<br>
When they say I'm on the loose?
<br>
Would you hide me when
<br>
My face is on the news?
<br>
'Cause I killed someone for you, yeah
